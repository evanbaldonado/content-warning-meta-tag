# Overview
Content warnings (and trigger warnings) are used to alert people of potentially distressing content so that they can appropriately prepare or disengage themselves.

## Purpose
By implementing the content-warnings meta tag, website publishers can mark their own webpages with content warnings to make the internet more inclusive and safe.

## Handling
In terms of handling these content warnings, functionality could be built into a browser (or browser extension) to display relevant content warnings before rendering the pageâ€™s contents to the user. Search engines, social media platforms, and other locations ripe with outgoing links could also implement content warnings for outgoing content based on this meta tag.

## Implementation
<meta> tags always belong inside the <head> element of HTML documents. For the content-warnings <meta> tag, the value of the name attribute is "content warnings," and the value of the content attribute is a comma-separated list of relevant content warning(s). Implementation is similar to the meta keywords tag, which is nowadays irrelevant in terms of SEO.

See [example.html](example.html) for an example implementation.
